## Environment Setup

To replicate our environment, run the following commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate your-env-name
```

This will install all required packages as listed in `environment.yml`.



## SMPL Model Preparation

To run the code, SMPL model files are required.

1. Visit the official SMPL website: [https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/)
2. Register for access and download the following models:
   - `basicModel_m_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl`
   - `basicModel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl`
3. Place these files in `src/smpl/` directory


## SMPL Model Conversion with mmMesh

Please follow these steps:

1. Visit the mmMesh [Xue *et al.*, 2021] repository:  
   [https://github.com/HavocFiXer/mmMesh/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#0-preliminary](https://github.com/HavocFiXer/mmMesh/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#0-preliminary)

2. Follow the instructions in "0. Preliminary" to generate:
   - `smpl_m.pkl`
   - `smpl_f.pkl`

3. Move the generated files into `src/smpl/` directory


## Training and Evaluation

To train or evaluate the model, navigate to the `src` directory and run the appropriate script:

```bash
cd src
python train.py   # For training
python test.py    # For evaluation
```
